     A"brother" whatever that means to you is someone who can be seen as a strong, positive role model.
     some who is there to back you up but also some one who can hold you accountable when you make mistakes."</em></p>

    <p class="text-small"><ul><li><em>"Brotherhood is an ideology of loyal friendship between individuals or communities. ...
        And, this healthy relationship is only possible when the the base of friendship is strong among the countries. 
        â€¢ So basically we can say that brotherhood is a direct necessity for maintaining the peace in our world."</em></p>

        First, The Fatherhood of God.
         The conception of God as Father can alone create that attitude of mind and heart which makes uni- versal brotherhood possible."</em></p>
